EggCrack
========

EggCrack is a well-known Minecraft account recovery tool. Popular for its intuitive interface and responsive design, EggCrack has recieved much praise over its two years of reliable yields and non-proprietary stance. Re-written and now open-source, the tool's sourcecode is available to you and potential contributors.

EggCrack originally gained its popularity on Nodus Forums back in 2013, when the original Java program was posted and garnered much attention. From there, a thread was made on MPGH (http://mpgh.net/), which holds much attention and remains the most popular thread in its section.
