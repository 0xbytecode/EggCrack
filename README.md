<h1>EggCrack</h1>

<p>
<b>Introduction</b><br/>
EggCrack is a well-known Minecraft account recovery tool. Popular for its intuitive interface and responsive design, EggCrack has recieved much praise over its two years of reliable yields and non-proprietary stance. Re-written and now open-source, the tool's sourcecode is available to you and potential contributors.
<br/><br/>
<b>Origins</b><br/>
EggCrack originally gained its popularity on Nodus Forums back in 2013, when the original Java program was posted and garnered much attention. From there, a thread was made on MPGH (http://mpgh.net/), which still holds much attention and remains the most popular thread in its section.
